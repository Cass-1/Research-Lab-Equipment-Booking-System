# Sprint x Report

## What's New (User Facing)
 * RBAC
    - there is now a distinction between different types of users: ADMIN, LAB_MANAGER, TEACHER, USER
    - pages are restricted by these roles
 * Lab Manager Frontend
    - lab managers can now do the following
      1. create lab sections
      2. add users to their lab sections
      3. add equipment to their lab sections

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint primarily focused on getting RBAC implemented and starting to create the systems for lab sections. Originally we planned to implement equipment booking this spritn but we realized that it was a larger endeavor than expected so we decided pretty early on to move it to sprint 3.

## Unfinished Work
We finished all of our expected tasks. For the next sprint we need to add ability for admins to update user roles as well as setup the booking system, analytics, and saving/exporting data.
